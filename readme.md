This program, palindromes.py, searches a user provided string for
all possible palindromes. The output of the program will be a list 
of all strings that are considered palindromes along with their 
position in the string and the corresponding length.  This list is
sorted primarily in decreasing order of palindrome length followed 
by an increasing order of position.  

To run this program, simply navigate to the directory that contains
this program and run it through the command line followed by your
string(s). Example:

python palindromes.py TypeYourUserInput RightHere


Additional notes: 
This program has been tested and run with Python 2.7.10.
If several strings are entered of which are separated by spaces, these 
spaces will be ignored.
If other symbols, or characters that are not letters and numbers, are 
passed through as input, the program will account for these symbols. 
Some symbols (for example '$') need to be properly escaped when passing
them as input through the command line.
